:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How do you write a lesson using R Markdown and `{sandpaper}`?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explain how to use markdown with the new lesson template
- Demonstrate how to include pieces of code, figures, and nested challenge blocks

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction

This is a lesson created via The Carpentries Workbench. It is written in
[Pandoc-flavored Markdown][pandoc] for static files and
[R Markdown][r-markdown] for dynamic files that can render code into output. 
Please refer to the [Introduction to The Carpentries 
Workbench][carpentries-workbench] for full documentation.

What you need to know is that there are three sections required for a valid
Carpentries lesson template:

 1. `questions` are displayed at the beginning of the episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives` are the learning objectives for an episode displayed with
    the questions.
 3. `keypoints` are displayed at the end of the episode to reinforce the
    objectives.

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges
associated with the lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

### Code fences

Code fences written in standard markdown format will be highlighted, but not
evaluated:

```bash
echo '47 + 2' | bc
echo '47 * 2' | bc
```

Code fences written using R Markdown chunk notation will be highlighted and 
executed:


``` r
magic <- sprintf("47 plus 2 equals %d\n47 times 2 equals %d", 47 + 2, 47 * 2) 
cat(magic)
```

``` output
47 plus 2 equals 49
47 times 2 equals 94
```

It's magic!

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

### Challenge 1: Can you do it?

What is the output of this command?

```r
paste("This", "new", "lesson", "looks", "good")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

### Output
 
```output
[1] "This new lesson looks good"
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


### Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

## Figures

You can also include figures generated from R Markdown:


``` r
pie(
  c(Sky = 78, "Sunny side of pyramid" = 17, "Shady side of pyramid" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("deepskyblue", "yellow", "yellow3"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="fig/example-rendered-pyramid-1.png" alt="pie chart illusion of a pyramid"  />
<p class="caption">Sun arise each and every morning</p>
</div>

Or you can use standard markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

For example:

`![You belong in The Carpentries!](fig/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.'}`

![You belong in The Carpentries!](fig/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.'}

[Additional attributes can be specified for the image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Img#attributes)
alongside the alternative text description in the `{}`.
Some, like `width` and `height`, can be specified directly:

`![You belong in The Carpentries!](fig/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.' width='25%'}`

![You belong in The Carpentries!](fig/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.' width='25%'}

## :art: Advanced Image Styling

More complex styling with arbitrary CSS is also possible within the Workbench,
by providing CSS directives (separated by `;`) to a `style` attribute inside the `{}`.

However, you should be aware that _all styling must be described in this `style` attribute
if it is present_, i.e. `width` and `height` must be included as CSS directives
_within the `style` attribute_ when it is used.

For example, to introduce some padding around the resized image:

`![You belong in The Carpentries!](fig/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.' style='padding:10px; width:25%'}`

![You belong in The Carpentries!](fig/Badge_Carpentries.svg){alt='Blue Carpentries hex person logo with no text.' style='padding:10px; width:25%'}

Note the use of `:` for the key-value pairs of CSS directives defined within `style`.

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
