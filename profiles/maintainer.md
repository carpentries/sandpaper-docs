title: Maintainer Profiles

Our maintainer community is full of individual with different motivations for
maintaining lessons. This page will catalog some maintainer profiles so that
we can identify how we can make the template easy to use for them.

## General Maintainers

Tamar Teosinte --- Pythonista, Machine Learning, Maize Genetics
:   Tamar is a graduate student maize geneticist who has developed a machine
learning algorithm to rapidly identify color changes in maize kernels that
identify tagged transposable genetic elements. She knows many students in her
field who could benefit from knowing how to write reproducible python
workflows, so she applies and becomes a maintainer for the [Plotting and
Programming with Python] lesson. She is proficient with Git, GitHub, and
Python. She has used R in her undergraduate statistics course, but has not used
it since. She uses the VSCode IDE and Anaconda Python for her work.


Testy Tsetse --- NOT a fly
:   Testy is definitely not a fly. They can program in python pretty well.
